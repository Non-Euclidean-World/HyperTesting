## Teleportation

### Description
Test case for checking if it's possible to get from one hypersphere to another.

The test case should work for spherical space.

### Prerequisites
The game is running in the spherical geometry mode.

### Steps
| Step | Action | Expected Result |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Move contantly in one direction (sidestepping any obstackles if necessary) | Eventually teleportation to the other hypersphere should take place, as can be seen [here](Resources/teleportation.mp4) |
